# üì° Nodus Passive Tracking System

Nodus is a modular ESP32-based passive tracking system designed to detect and localize nearby mobile devices using Wi-Fi and BLE scanning. It consists of two main components:

- **Gateway**: A central base station that connects to Wi-Fi, receives ESP-NOW data from nodes, and relays it to an MQTT server or web dashboard.
- **Node**: A low-power device that passively scans for nearby phones and reports sightings via ESP-NOW to the gateway.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Nodus system is built to track presence, movement, and approximate location of nearby devices in physical spaces like buildings, venues, or events ‚Äî all without requiring any app install or active pairing.

Nodes and gateways form a local mesh over ESP-NOW, making the system highly resilient and requiring minimal infrastructure. The gateway provides a web-based dashboard for viewing real-time device check-ins, and optionally relays data upstream via MQTT.

## ‚úÖ Current Features

### Gateway
- SoftAP on boot for WiFiManager config (SSID, MQTT broker, etc.)
- Hosts a local dashboard showing connected devices and their last heartbeat
- Listens for ESP-NOW packets from nodes and optionally from hubs
- Displays device role (node or hub) in dashboard logs
- Supports reset and reconfiguration via web interface

### Node
- Scans for a `nodus-gateway` SoftAP to determine Wi-Fi channel
- Initializes ESP-NOW on the correct channel after scanning
- Broadcasts heartbeat packets with node ID
- Scans for BLE and Wi-Fi devices (planned)
- Sends passive detection data to the gateway via ESP-NOW (in development)

## üîß In Development

- [ ] Node-side passive device scanning (BLE, Wi-Fi)
- [ ] ESP-NOW packet structure for tracking payloads
- [ ] Dashboard real-time updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Node triangulation and heatmap support
- [ ] MQTT relaying for backend analytics
- [ ] Auto-pairing and role-based behavior (hub, node, gateway)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Flash either sketch to an ESP32 dev board:

- Gateway: use ESP32-WROOM with WiFi + ESP-NOW support
- Node: use low-power ESP32 or S3 module

Ensure `WiFiManager` is available in Arduino/PlatformIO environment.

## üìÖ Project Status

> Currently working on: **Node scanning and data reporting logic**

- Gateway is functional and provides a configurable dashboard
- Node can determine correct Wi-Fi channel and heartbeat to gateway
- BLE/Wi-Fi scanning and device fingerprinting in progress
